194,,,,32.0,,,,"Too many people even especially IT considered mental health issues as a choice or something people can freely act about. 

You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. 

In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(

I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health ""issues"" keep it for themselves.

Likewise, I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless, I don't regret being public and raising awareness.

1077,,,,27.0,,,,"I answered based on previous job at large technical company, where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.

I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope, I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) ""deserved"" stress was anxiety, caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing, I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.

It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing), I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.

Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:
1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day, four years later, despite being ""stable"" I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that, it would be seen as ""oh, I'm sorry"". I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.
2) Accomodations.
- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead, they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily, as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive, unnecessary appointment).
- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open, but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up, but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.
- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits, as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR, I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and ""putting on my dick hat"" to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling, and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package, I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being ""medically disqualified from this role"". I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.",,No,,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Yes,,,,,,,,Yes,,,Maybe,,No,,No,,,,,Yes,,Yes,,,,Female,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,Yes,,,,Very difficult,,More than 1000,,,,,,,,,,,Often,,,,,,,,,,,WA,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Some of them,,,No,Maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,2014

1173,,,,23.0,,,,"I burnt out this year. I worked too much, had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.

I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating, sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work, couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.

My employers response, after a while, was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor, which my employer agreed to, only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent, bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat, gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.

I can adapt quickly to jobs involving heavy lifting, for example, but would not admit that it would probably wind me to start with.  Most physical health issues severe enough to discuss are visible, and if they are not (say I have cancer and am going to be going on chemo) I would not discuss because of huge possibility of not being hired due to potential for medical leave / lots of absence.  ","Mental health issues are hugely stigmatized.  I made the mistake of letting my last employer find out that I had ADHD and an adderall prescription not really thinking about it.  The head of engineering would joke about me ""doing meth"" after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It's not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country's state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading.

In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.", I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...,Maybe,,,,,No,,,,,,,,"No, at none of my previous employers",Some of my previous employers,,,,2016

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.

When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!)

I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify.

He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.","Really just in passing a few times, no particular reaction.",,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,None did,None did,,,,,,Yes,,,I don't know,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know,Not eligible for coverage / NA,,,,,,,Cis female ,,,No,,Yes,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,Yes,,,Maybe/Not sure,"Yes, I observed",,,No,I don't know,,,26-100,10,,Very easy,,,"You are responsible for your own healthcare in my country, your employer has nothing to do with it.
